MetalDector is a bukkit plugin for helping players find ores while mining.

To use MetalDetector, one must have a diamond pickaxe, then right-click.
A report will be displayed in the following format:
ORE : Cluster size - Relative Location
for example...
IRON_ORE : 8 - (4,-5,3)

This means a cluster of eight iron ores has been detected, and for the player
to reach it, they must go 4 forward, 5 down, and 3 right

The MetalDetector (diamond pickaxe) has a range of 8, however, this range
may be increased to 16 if the player has a solid block of diamond within their
inventory
